# GitHub Flavourful Markdown

The file extension "markdown", .md, is used by web writers and developers to convert easy-to-read files with a .txt extension to HTML

This format can also be edited in GitHub directly by combining a syntax for formatting text called GitHub Flavoured Markdown with some unique writing features 

The syntax is very easy to use. Here are some examples:

**Bold texts are to be created using** ** ** or __ __ 

*Italic texts are to be created using* * * or _ _

**We can also nest _the syntax together to created bolded, italicized text_** 

This is how we create a quote using (>):
> This is a quote

This entire document can easily be converted to and from txt and HTML!
